# Heat-Mass-Transfer-from-droplet-in-ambient-shearing-flow

- Investigating heat and mass transfer in circulating droplets influenced by settling and an axial electric field.
- Electric field can be either steady or oscillatory, generating a Taylor circulation flow.
- Employing four dimensionless parameters, including the Peclet number (Pe), to assess the dominance of convection over diffusion.
- Quantifying the non-dimensional transport rate using the Nusselt number (Nu).
- Utilizing stochastic simulations based on Langevin equations for individual tracers to model transport mechanisms.
- Main objective: Establishing the relationship between Pe and Nu numbers and seeking methods to enhance transport rates in complex chaotic shearing flows.
